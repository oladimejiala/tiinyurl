Prompt for TiinyURL: A One-Page URL Shortener Web App
Objective: Build a clean, responsive, single-page web app for shortening URLs with optional customization and analytics. Prioritize simplicity, performance, and user experience.

Core Features:
URL Shortening:

Input field for long URLs with validation (ensure valid HTTP/HTTPS format).

Instant generation of a short, unique link (e.g., tiinyurl.com/abc123) using Base62 encoding (not hash-based) to keep URLs compact.

No login required for basic shortening.

User Experience:

Minimalist UI: Centered input field + "Shorten" button.

Display shortened URL prominently with a copy-to-clipboard button.

Visual feedback (e.g., toast notification) on copy success.

Mobile-responsive design (use CSS Flexbox/Grid + media queries).

Customization (Optional):

Allow users to customize the alias (e.g., urlshortener1.com/mysite).

Real-time validation to check alias availability.

Auto-generate a QR code for each shortened link with download option (use a lightweight library like qrcode.js).

Analytics (Basic):

Track total clicks per shortened link.

Display stats in a simple dashboard (e.g., bar chart for clicks over time).

Redirects:

Serverless redirect logic (e.g., Netlify/Cloudflare Functions or Firebase Dynamic Links).

Handle 404s gracefully (redirect to a default page or show error).

Technical Stack Suggestions:
Frontend: React/Vue.js (for reactivity) or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for simplicity.

Backend: Firebase (Firestore + Cloud Functions) or Vercel Edge Functions.

Database: Firebase Firestore or Supabase (free tier).

QR Code: qrcode.js or react-qr-code.

Deployment: Vercel/Netlify (serverless-friendly).

Stretch Goals:
Bulk URL shortening (paste multiple links).

Premium tier (Stripe integration for custom domains/ad-free experience).

Ad monetization: Google AdSense (only for free users).

Example Prompt for AI (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4):
*"Build a single-page URL shortener web app called TiinyURL using React and Firebase. The app should include:

Base62 encoding for short URLs (not random hashes).

Optional custom aliases with real-time uniqueness checks.

QR code generation for each link.

A click counter for analytics.

Copy-to-clipboard functionality with visual feedback.
Use Firebase Firestore for storage and Firebase Hosting for deployment. Keep the UI clean and mobile-friendly."*
